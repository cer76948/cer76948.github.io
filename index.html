<h1 style="font-family:arial;text-align:center;color:#990033"> Canopy Studio: A Home Away from Home </h1>
<h2 style="font-family:arial;"> Canopy Studio is Athens' premiere aerial arts studio. The studio has won numerous local awards for both adult and kid movement classes.
  Canopy offers dozens of classes from beginner to advanced levels in trapeze, aerial silks (pictured), lyra, and even pole classes through the Athens Pole Academy.

  <h2 style="font-family:arial;"> I have been a student on and off at Canopy for 4 years and every time I'm in the studio my heart sings! I can fly around the space and feel as free as I possibly can! 
     in 2017, I was in the <A href = "https://flagpole.com/arts-culture/art-notes/2017/07/26/em-jupiter-gets-wet-em-and-takes-flight">Summer Splash show inspired by the book Juniper Gets Wet by Bart King.</A>
     I played the Princess and performed on the aerial sling to a mashup of Abba's "Dancing Queen" and Queen's "Killer Queen". Through this song, I embodied the royalty and power of this generous Princess. Listen to this mix below! </h2>
